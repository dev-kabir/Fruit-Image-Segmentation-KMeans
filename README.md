# Fruit Image Segmentation using K-Means

This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for segmenting fruits in an image. The code allows you to visualize the segmentation results and disable specific clusters to observe the impact on the fruit representation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/dev-kabir/Fruit-Image-Segmentation-KMeans.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib


3. Place your fruit image in the root directory and update the `image_path` variable in `main.py` with the image file name.

4. Adjust the number of clusters (`k`) and the cluster to disable (`cluster_to_disable`) in `main.py` as per your preference.

5. Run the script to see the original image, segmented image, and masked image side by side:
